## External Field Animations

To produce the voltage plot and the electric field data for the square capacitor, I used Vgen.C and VgenVec.C with parameters -I 1000 and -N 256. These two files use the Makefile with the capital "M". The PIC simulation is run using the makefile with the lowercase "m". To switch between circular and square configurations in the PIC simulation, there is are a few commented out lines at the beginning of main.cpp that can be switched back and forth. Most of the plots are generated by the jupyter-lab notebook.
